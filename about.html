					<p>Our team met one fateful summer day. Lida and Jamel were teachers of Spanish and Latin, with a vision to help their students learn more effectively. Thierry was a tech and business savvy man, ready to use his skills to help make the world a better place. A Startup Weekend brought them together in 2014, and they’ve been together ever since with united efforts to improve foreign language classrooms. From the beginning we’ve been working with foreign language teachers to make the best product possible. We interviewed dozens of teachers before we wrote our first line of code, and have run pilots with teachers across the US in public and private schools, with students as young as 5th grade and as old as 12th grade. </p>
					<p>Shortly after joining forces, ClassTracks traveled to New Orleans to learn from the wizened advisors of the Edtech world at 4.0 Schools. We now call Baltimore home with our base at the Emerging Technologies Center (ETC).</p>
